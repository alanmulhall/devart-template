## Description
Selfie is a study into the popularity of the modern day self portrait, what it means to us and society at large. 

Never before in the history of art has there been such a large and democratic distribution channel for creative output as provided today by the internet.

Thoughout this project I will be exploring the effects of the Selfie and the explosion of creativity that the internet and mobile technologies has allowed.

I will be using various open source technologies to produce an emersive realtime installation inspired by the selfie.
