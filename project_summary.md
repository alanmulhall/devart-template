## Description
#### Overview
Selfie is a study into the popularity of the modern day self portrait, what it means to us and society at large. 

Never before in the history of art has there been such a large and democratic distribution channel for creative output as provided today by the internet.

Thoughout this project I will be exploring the effects of the Selfie and the explosion of creativity that the internet and mobile technologies has allowed.

#### Project
I will be using various open source technologies to produce an emersive realtime installation inspired by the selfie.

##### The Experience

A person is walking by and notices the exhibit for #selfies. They walk into the room and see all the walls and roof covered in grids of selfies from instagram.

There is a nice animation on the selfie images where the color and saturation are changing. Ever so often a selfie gets replace with a new one coming from the realtime Instagram API.

The person walks out and takes a selfie and tags it on Instagram with the tag #selfie and now they are part of the exhibit.
